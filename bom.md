# Bill Of Materials
i haven't finalised anything yet, so im just using this as a list of screw sizes and other bits for now :)

This BOM is split into three parts, based on which configuration you're making.  The Common section lists parts required for every configuration of the bot, while Big Cat- and Little Cat-specific parts are listed in their own sections.
